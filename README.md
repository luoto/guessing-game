# Guess!

A guessing game which can be played by a user against the computer. This is a game where the secret-keeper thinks of a word, and the guesser tries to guess it one letter at a time. The guesser has six guesses. If the guesser guesses a letter which is part of the word, the secret-keeper will reveal all occurences of that letter in the word. If the guesser guesses a correct letter such that all letters are revealed, the game is over and player 2 has one. Instead of player 2 runs out of guesses before the whole word is discovered, the game is over and player 1 has won.

The words can be very challenging, so don't feel bad if you lose.
